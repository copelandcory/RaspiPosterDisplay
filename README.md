# RaspiPosterDisplay
My code for a conference poster I've augmented with an interactive display run through a Raspberry Pi 3.

Implimenting this will require a Raspberry pie, LED display, and joystick.

This is a work in progress.  I can't recommend using any of the code at this point.

All data here at the moment is test data with no specific significance.  Do not draw any conclusions based on the included maps.
They were made to procide testing data for the project.
